<P><span>Day One</span>
<BR>This meditation is very important. You need to add this to your daily meditations. It is simple and the more you do this, the more powerful the protective aura becomes. We will be doing very advanced magick and you will need the protective aura. 
 
<P> 1. Go into a trance.
<p>2. Breathe in white-gold energy.*
You don't need to expand your aura with this. Just visualize a strong
brilliant barrier of your aura as you would when you contract it,
like an outline of your aura.
 
<p>3. Affirm: "I am breathing in powerful protective energy. This is building an aura of protection around me. This aura
protects me at all times."
 
<P>You can change this, but always word it in the present tense. The
more you do this, you will build a more and more powerful protective
aura. Use the energy from the Sun as well.
 
<P>&nbsp;<span>*White-gold energy is used because it is reflective.</span>
 
<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>

<P><span>Day Two</span>
<BR>Meditation on the spirit. 
 
<P>The properties of the spirit in correspondence to
the elements are as follows: <BR>the will is of the fire element, the intellect  and memory are of air,  all  aspects of feeling are of
the water element, and all aspects of consciousnessthat connect the three
elements is of the earth element.
 
<P>1. Go into a trance and focus inward into your own spirit, try to be aware of and feel your spirit/astral body and meditate on it.
 
<P>2. Meditate on each aspect of the above mentioned elements in correspondence to the parts of your spirit. 
 
<P><BR><span>What this exercise does:</span>
<P>This is important as it hones each aspect of your soul to work magick. It will enable you to influence these aspects within yourself and also when you master them, within others. You will eventually, with practice learn to strengthen or eliminate them.
 
 
<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>
 
<P><span>Day Three</span>
<BR>Meditating on your astral body 
<P>Go into a trance and meditate on your astral body within your physical body. Try to feel your astral body and be aware of it. Once you are aware of and can feel your astral body and focus upon it, do the following during your daily activities:
 
<P>The following is an excerpt from "Initiation Into Hermetics" by Franz Bardon:
<BR>*Note: Bardon's works are easily available in pdf online. Bardon stole his knowledge from a German Satanist known as "Wilhelm Quintischer." Quintischer's writings are not readily available. New Agers who act as 'holier than thou' neglect to mention this or give credit to where it is due. 
 
<br><I>"For example, if I am walking along the road I do
not think about the fact that I am walking, but that my spirit is walking and moving the astral and the
material feet. The same thing happens to the arms and all the other parts of the body. If you are able to
accomplish any action in this way for at least ten minutes, you are mastering the exercise perfectly. 
 
<P>The
longer you can endure this without side effect such as dizziness or disturbances of balance, all the better
for you. For this particular reason it is advisable to begin first with small actions over a short spell of time
and to extend them as long as you like.
This experiment is very important because it will give the scholar the possibility to accomplish any action
with a mental as well as astral connection with the material body according to his working with the mental or the astral sphere. Such an action is called the magical action. The scholar will certainly
understand now why magic rituals never show any success with persons who have not been initiated or
who have not been trained in magic, because people like these do not own the capacity of executing the
ritual magically, i.e., they are not prepared to work in connection with the material stuff in a mental and
astral way.</I>
 
<P>When performing healings on another, it is the astral body you are working with, both your own and the one who is receiving the healing energy. 
 
<P>Getting in touch with your astral body and being aware of it is very important. I have worked directly with two of the so-called 'dead' who have been residing in Hell. They do not like being called 'dead.' Only the physical body is 'dead.' Those who have departed from this world are very much alive, though in spirit form [if they have not yet been reincarnated]. Upon meeting one individual for the first time, he grabbed and kissed my astral hand. When working with those who are in spirit form, one will use one's astral body as well. This is how one can feel being touched or even entered [with consent] from another who is in spirit form. The use of the astral body is also essential in working magick, healing and such. It is important that you have a keen awareness of the different aspects of your soul to advance in spiritual power. 
 
<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>
 
 
<P><span>Days Four and Five</span>
<BR>Get comfortable and enter into a trance. 
 
<P> Imagine that you are in the center of an unlimited space, a void. There is no above or below or sideways. This unlimited space is filled with ultra-violet light,
near black-violet color. This is the higher wavelength of light that is of a faster speed; the invisible spectrum of light that is part of the human soul. The human soul is made of light. The main chakras are composed of the visible light spectrum. There are higher and lower light wavelengths that make up the human soul.  
 
<P>Breathe in this energy with your entire body as you learned with the <A HREF="../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Foundation_Meditation.html">foundation meditation.</a> 
 
 
 
<P>By focusing on this ether/akasha energy and intentionally implanting in it through will and focus, a desire, it will carry this and manifest in reality. [Affirmations should always be used when doing this].

<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>
 
<P><span>Day Six</span>
 
<P>1. Go int a light trance. 
 
<P>2. Breathe in the element of fire and upon the exhale, direct all of it to your base chakra, so it is concentrated. 
 
<P>3. Do this for five breaths. 
 
<P>4. Meditate upon and feel the heat in your base chakra. 
 
<P>If you feel uncomfortable doing this, you can substitute directing the water element into your sacral chakra. Either do one or the other.
 
<P><BR><P>What this does is to train you to concentrate and direct an element. This can also be done outside of your body and for advanced magick, you will need this skill. It must be taken slowly though. This is very advanced. The fire element will stimulate your kundalini. Directing the elements to specific parts of the body can also be used to heal. NEVER DIRECT THE FIRE ELEMENT TO YOUR HEART OR YOUR BRAIN!! This can be very dangerous and can cause permanent damage to these organs. 
 
<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>
 
<P><span>Day Seven</span>
<P>Follow the instructions on this <a href="../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Advanced_Thoughtforms.html">WEBPAGE</a>
 
 
<P>My suggestion is to use green and program the thoughtform to attract money to you. Be sure to make the command short and to the point and include that this is money for you to keep and spend as you wish. The money should come to you within a week or less, depending on the strength of the thoughtform.  
 
<P><BR><P>We will be getting into extremely advanced magick soon and will be creating very advanced elemental thoughtforms that obey commands and that can be kept within objects; leaving the object to do its job and then returning after the mission is completed. 
 
<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>
 
 
<P><span>Day Eight</span>
<P>Program your aura to attract something you want. The results here can be amazing. The point is, you can use your aura to bring you whatever you need. Start out with something easy and gradually work on more difficult things. Attempting something too difficult can end in failure and be discouraging. Also, what you ask for has to be physically possible. Any type of mind working will take the easiest available route to get you what you want, so be sure to be specific. For example, when making an affirmation to attract money, if one only affirms for attracting money, the money may come and even be in one's hands, but this could be like a bank teller or cashier or the money may belong to or be taken by another. 
 
<P><BR><P>1. Go into a light trance
 
<P>2. <a href="../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Foundation_Meditation.html">Breathe in energy.</a> White or gold is all-purpose and can be used, but you can also use 
<a href="../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Color.html">color energy</a> depending on what you want. Fill your entire being full of this energy until you are glowing with it. 
 
<P>3. Now, program your aura. Affirm: My aura is attracting to me__________ easily and effortlessly. State this several times; 5-10 times. 
 
<P>4. Now, put this out of your mind and do not think about it. If you are powerful enough, what you programmed your aura to bring to you should come within a short period of time. 
 
<P><BR><P>To cite an example, I wanted a certain CD. The CD was out of print and nowhere to be found. No stores or internet sales outlets had it. I programmed my aura one morning to bring me the CD. I had the CD that very afternoon and got it for free. Now, you have to go with the flow and often search for what you programmed your aura to attract in a lot of cases, but the point is- it will be there if your aura is powerful enough. 
 
 
<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>
 
 
<P><span>Day Nine</span>
<P>Because of the importance of working with and mastering the ether/akasha, we are repeating this exercise, as was done on Days Four and Five [above].
 
 
<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center> 
<P><span>Day Ten</span>
 
<P>1.Go into a medium trance and breathe akasha/ether as in yesterday's exercise and fill your entire being with it. 
 
<P>2.Do this for ten breaths and then meditate on the feeling this energy gives you for 10-15 minutes. 
 
<P>4. The key to this meditation is self-confidence. 
 
<P><BR><P>By working with the akasha, you will learn to master the elements, which is essential to advanced magick.

<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center> 
 
<P><span>Days Eleven Through Twenty</span>
<BR>Astral Projection
<P>For those of you who already have this ability, work to strengthen it and perfect it. Real astral projection is not just placing your consciousness somewhere else, it is willing your soul to leave your body. 
 
<P>Methods of astral projection are as individual as ourselves. What may work for one person, may not work for another. For those of you who have had difficulty achieving this goal, I recommend you ask your Guardian Demon to work with you. If you do not know your Guardian, then go to Satan and ask him to send you a Demon to work with you. 
 
<P>For the next seven days, work on astral projection. Below in the link are different methods used to astral project and an informative pdf book. Please study these and work on exiting your body. Remember, to come back, just visualize yourself inside of your body, feel yourself lying on your bed or sitting in your chair or what ever you were doing and you will be right there again. Be sure to take time to allow your soul to settle back in or you can feel out of sorts for days. Lie still for several minutes and get up alowly and then try to do something physical like eat some food.  
 
<P><BR><P><a href="../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Meditations_for_Astral_Projection.html">Link for Astral Projection Information</a>
 
<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>
 
<P><span>Day Twenty-One</span>
<P>When your goals are personal and pertain to yourself, this is the time to invoke energy and project it from yourself. 
 
<P>Evoking energy is different. When spells are for others, it is important to evoke energy as energy that you project from yourself will establish a connection with the person you send it to. Both in cursing and healing, for obvious reasons, this is undesirable. The energy you use must be taken from the universe. It is very important to master both evocation and invocation of the elements in order to progress to advanced levels of ability. 
 
<P><BR><P>Evoking Fire
<BR>Get into a trance and visualize you are in the middle of fire. Feel the heat and hear the hissing and crackling of the flames and feel the burning. Now, begin to collect and condense that fire into a sphere in front of you. Draw the fire element from all directions into the sphere in front of you. The more of the fire element you direct into the sphere, the more dense, material, and hotter it will become. You should feel the heat while you are doing this. The more you compress and condense the fire, the more the heat will grow. You should actually have the sensation of literally being in an oven.
 
<P>Now dissolve the sphere of fire by visualizing it dissipating – the exact opposite of when you brought it together. Keep working at visualizing it dissipating, losing its strength, power and heat and eventually dissolving into nothing.  
 
<P>Reference: Initiation Into Hermetics" by Franz Bardon
 
 
<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>
 
<P><span>Day Twenty-Two</span>
<BR>Evoking Air
<p>Get into a trance and visualize you are in the middle of air, fill the entire room with it. Draw the air from all directions simultaneously into a sphere in front of you. Fill and pack the sphere with the air element. You should feel very light, as though you are floating.
<P>When you are finished packing the air into the sphere, dissolve it as you did with the fire sphere.
 
<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>
 
 
<P><span>Day Twenty-Three</span>
<BR>Evoking Water
<p>Get into a trance and visualize you are in the middle of an ocean or lake. Draw the water element from all directions. Feel the water at first as a cold vapor, the closer you draw it to your body, as you condense the water more and more, you should feel icy cold. Now, pack the water element into a sphere in front of you and then dissolve it, the same as you did with the fire and air. Let it evaporate away into nothingness. 

 <P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>
 
<P><span>Day Twenty-Four</span>
<BR>Evoking Earth
<p>Get into a trance and draw a gray mass, similar to clay, from all directions simultaneously. The closer you bring it to yourself, it becomes browner and browner, rich like soil and more dense. Fill the room entirely
with the heavy mass of the earth element and visualize it compacting into a sphere. Feel the heaviness and the gravity and its pressure on your body. When finished, dissolve it as you did with the other elements. 
 
<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>
 
<P><span>Day Twenty-Five</span>
<BR>Using the fire element
<P>Evoke the element of fire again, but this time, have a glass of tepid water in front of you and draw the fire from all directions and condense it into the glass of water. It is best to use a clear glass with this exercise. Imagine the water getting hotter and hotter with the fire element. 
 
<P>If you are successful, the water will increase in temperature by a few degrees. When finished, you can taste the water and it should have an unusual taste to it if you were successful. 
 
<P>Later on, when you find you can raise the temperature of tepid water, then work with colder and colder water and practice the same. 
 
<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>
 
<P><span>Days Twenty-Six Through Twenty-Eight</span>
<BR>Working with colors 1
<P>Take three brightly colored objects. All must have the same texture and feel, but must be different colors. Take each one at a time in your hand and feel it. Close your eyes and feel it some more. 
<P>Visualize the color while you hold and run your fingers over the object in your hands. Say to yourself in your mind: <BR>"This is how the color (name of color) feels and I will recognize the color_____ when I feel it in the future." 
 
<P>The more you do this exercise, you will soon be able to feel each color as distinct and seperate. It is important to be sensitive enough when working with energy to sense different colors. This will also help with invoking and evoking them and in seeing auras. 
 
<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>
 
<P><span>Days Twenty-Nine Through Thirty-One</span>
<BR>Working with colors 2
<P>Enter into your trance state. 
 
<P>Breathe in and fill yourself with each breath with a specific color of the spectrum, visualizing it as brighter and brighter each time.
Red, blue, yellow, orange, violet, green, indigo (bluish-violet, the color of the 6th chakra) or black. This meditation can also be done after meditating on a specific chakra. You can then fill yourself with the color of that chakra. 
 
<P>Hold the color for two to four minutes. If the color feels pleasant, you can hold for a longer period of time. Those who are used to the energy of the colors can hold much longer. One’s increased time should be comfortable and gradual. 
 
<P>Each color should be in its pure form and bright. Later on, it is fine to experiment with different shades when adept. 
 
<P>If a color feel negative to you, work with it gradually. Ask your mind for an answer as to why. What does the color mean to you? What associations do you have with a particular color? This is a great way to find out more about yourself. Which colors feel pleasant to you? These are the ones that you may be using the most in your life to the exclusion of others. Knowing this provides information as to which chakras need more work to bring them up to full power. 
 
<P>The most important objective of this meditation is to *feel* the colors. Spend some time with each color, getting into how it feels. Keep a written record in your book of shadows/black book. 
 
<P>The benefits of this meditation are the ability to feel, direct and apply color. Color energy is exceptionally powerful when used in magick. Each color has specific energies and acts to bring results unique to that energy.
