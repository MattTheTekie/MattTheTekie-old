### You found me, congratulations !

Greetings young mortal, I AM SATAN!

I'm a small developer demon, aiming to discover and traverse through countless of the oceans, jungles, and voyage throughout the magestical depths of space bound to gain a fleet through the indefinite stars.

I love playing around with the terminal, sometimes scripting away, devouring Linux bugs and tormenting them to my pawns.

- ðŸ”­ I'm a **HUGE** Astronomy and Astrophysics fan!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently preparing something.
- ðŸ“« I'm a **HUGE** Linux user! DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE DECADE OF MY VOYAGE!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm stubborn (whoops !).
