<P><BR><font face="Verdana,Arial" size=3>It is a sad fact that few Satanists know 
the real meaning of our symbols. Most take false and erroneous information from 
Christian sources. Christians show their stupidity and ignorance incessantly. 
Knowledge is their most formidable enemy for no scam, no hoax, nor any lie can 
succeed when one has knowledge of the truth. Every Satanic symbol represents 
powerful spiritual meaning in regards to humanity reaching the godhead of 
spiritual and physical perfection and immortality. Most if not all Satanic 
symbols pertain to the true spiritual knowledge and the human soul.

    <TD vAlign=top>THE SERPENT: The most sacred symbol in Satanism. The 
      serpent represents the <A 
      href="../../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Kundalini.html">kundalini 
      force</A> at the base of the spine. When the serpent is activated through 
      power meditation and specific exercises, it ascends through the seven 
      chakras, bringing intense awareness, enlightenment, psychic powers and 
      abilities, and all-knowing. The hooded cobra, seen in many ancient 
      carvings and paintings in Egypt, symbolizes the resulting expanded 
      consciousness of raising the serpent. This is the TRUE foundation of 
      Satanism- raising the serpent. Those who are successful in raising the 
      serpentine energy are on a much higher spiritual level and can no longer 
      be deceived by Christianity and its related programs. </TR></TBODY></TABLE>

      the elixer of life. The Catholic Church STOLE this concept and corrupted 
      it. The Grail is part of the Magnum Opus, the potential of which we have 
      within ourselves. It is not a material object, it is a concept. The "blood 
      of the chakras" is the energy they leak when stimulated. The Grail is 
      depicted as "Royal Blood." this is the 'blood' of the chakras.

<P><BR>The colors RED, WHITE, and BLACK date back not only to Ancient Egypt, but 
to their origins in the Far East. Egypt was known as the "Black and Red Land" 
and was the center of Alchemy. Alchemy is the transformation of the human soul 
into the godhead. Through this transformation, we complete Our Creator Satan's 
unfinished work. The colors red, white and black are of the three major nadis of 
the human soul. The Ida is black, the Pingala is red, and the Sushumna is white. 
 
<P><BR>"DARKNESS" <BR>The association of "darkness" with Satanism has been 
totally twisted. This is not about spooks, ghouls or any other crap like that. 
Satanic "darkness" has to do with the "yin" in the "yang." This represents the 
female side of the soul; the subconscious mind that we access through 
meditation. The Serpent of Satan is of the female side of the soul. The male 
side of the soul is the logical side- the left brain. The female side is the 
right side of the brain. The soul has both positive and negative poles. Both the 
male and the female must work together. The logical male side; the left brain 
directs the female side through thought and will. The female side of the soul is 
the powerhouse of the soul. The female side makes manifest the thoughts and 
ideas generated from the male logical side. The female side is also the creative 
aspect of the soul; dreams, music, feelings and intuitions. Because of the power 
to direct one's own destiny and the spiritual freedom that comes with this are 
of the female side of the soul, the Christian Churches and their related ilk, 
such as Islam, work at promoting an inferior image of women; with Islam being 
brutal to women, and the incessant denegrations of women in the Judeo/Christian 
bible. All of this in addition reflects on the subconscious, subliminal level to 
suppress and deny the female power of the soul. Through centuries of this 
enforced garbage, which is nothing more than a program to remove spirituality, 
the female side of the soul and its powers have atrophied. This is why humanity 
and this world are in such an ugly mess right now. This has created a most 
serious imbalance that has become generational. Satanism works through <A 
href="../../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Satanic_Meditation.html">power 
meditation</A> to empower the female side of the soul to regain balance and 
restore spiritual health, along with empowering the individual.

    <TD vAlign=top><IMG src="Trident2.gif">
    <TD vAlign=top>The "Devil's Pitchfork" is actually a very ancient symbol 
      predating Christianity by thousands of years. This symbol originated in 
      the Far East [where Christianity and its Jewish root stole from copiously; 
      hideously perverting and corrupting the massive theft beyond recogntion, 
      in order to destroy spiritual knowledge and keep spiritual power in the 
      hands of the "Chosen" few]. It is known as the "TRISHUL" and symbolizes 
      piercing through the three knots in the base, the heart and 6th chakras, 
      also known as "granthis" in Sanskrit. For the serpent to ascend, all three 
      must be open. The Trishul symbolizes the serpentine energy piercing 
      through the three granthis. <BR><BR>The image of Baphomet of western 
      occultism was taken from the image of Shiva [above]. Note the position of 
      the arms, one pointing upwards and the other downwards. The Baphomet again 
      is symbolic of both the male and the female aspects of the soul. Note the 
      Baphomet is both male and female, as also seen with in images of the 
      Egyptian God Akhenaton. The horns are symbolic of Mercury, which is the 
      vril, chi, witchpower, lifeforce, prana.

      goat symbolizes fertility- fertility in multiplying the life force, vril, 
      which activates and raises the serpent. The "Goat of a Thousand Young" is 
      referring to the crown chakra, "Sahasrara" in Sanskrit which means 
      "Thousand Petaled Lotus."</TR></TBODY></TABLE>

      vril, chi...This is symbolized by the symbol for the planet Mercury [shown 
      directly below]. "Mercury" is known as "Messenger of the Gods." "God/s" is 
      a code-word for the chakras. Note the horns shown on the image of Azazel

the Sun. 666 is the all-important solar chakra. The true meaning of the "Temple of Solomon" is the <I>TEMPLE OF THE

for the Sun and is close to the English word "soul." "Om" is a name given by the 
Hindus to the Spiritual Sun and "On" is an Egyptian word for Sun. The symbolism 
of the Temple of Solomon was stolen by the Jews and made into a fictitious 
character, as with the fictitous nazarene and nearly everything in the 
Judeo/Christian Bible. For more information: <BR><A

    <TD vAlign=top>The true meaning of the "Temple of the Sun" is spiritual. 
      This symbolizes the perfected soul, where the rays from the solar [666] chakra, 
      which is the center of the soul and circulates spiritual energy, radiates 
      into 8 separate rays. The shining soul is symbolized by the sun. 8 is the 
      number of Astaroth. This is also "The New Jerusalem." The name of 
      "Jerusalem" has also been stolen and corrupted into a city in Israel. 
      "Jerusalem" IS A CONCEPT!

on the two Satanic symbols on the far right above, the number 8 is the symbol 
for infinity/immortality. The 8 is turned on its side. The double cross 
symbolizes the human soul at the solar [666] and heart/shoulder chakras. The 8 pointed star 
to the left is the Star of Astaroth. The Catholic Church labeled this as "Sigil of the Beast." Anything 
having to do with spirituality has been maligned, slandered, blasphemed and 
desecrated by the Christian Churches. <BR>The shining perfected soul is also

<BR>Concerning the Solar Chakra and Freemasonry:
The character "Hiram Abiff" is another allegory. Note
"HIRAM" is a very ancient mantra for the Sun. The Black Sun [astral Sun]. Hrim
ties into the freemason Hiram Abiff. “presented to all candidates during the third
degree in Freemasonry.” Note THIRD- the third solar chakra. The gold chakra.
The Sun chakra, which is also symbolized by the swastika.
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiram_Abiff">From Wikipedia: article on Hiram Abiff</a>
Hiram Abiff (also Hiram Abif or the Widow's son) is the central character of an
allegory presented to all candidates during the third degree in Freemasonry.
Hiram is presented as the chief architect of King Solomon's Temple, who is
murdered in the Temple he designed by three ruffians during an unsuccessful
attempt to force him to divulge the Master Masons' secret passwords.
<BR>NOTE: “Hiram is presented as the chief architect of King Solomon's Temple.” In
other words, the solar chakra symbolized by the Satanic inverted cross, is the
source of the magnum opus and the powerhouse of the soul. This is also
symbolized by Thor's Hammer.
The solar chakra is the "architect of the soul." All energy to empower your soul
comes from this chakra. The solar chakra being located near the navel is also the spot where we were first nourished and given life in our mother's womb. Hiram
Abiff is not a character, but a CONCEPT. The "secret passwords" are the
mantras and words of power that awaken and empower the chakras.
All of the ancient Pagan religions placed emphasis on the Sun. The Sun is the
giver of life and this also includes the astral Sun of the soul; the "Temple of
Solomon." The solar chakra also plays a key role in the magnum opus.
