True Satanism is based upon the ancient religions that predated Judaism, 
Christianity, and Islam by hundreds to thousands of years. The traditional 
colors of black and red used in Satanism, date all the way back to Ancient Egypt 
and are symbolic of spiritual transformation. The ancient religions were based 
upon completing our Creator Satan's work: that of transforming the human soul 
into that of a god and achieving god-like power and immortality. Satan's Kingdom 
was stolen from him. 
<P>The Judeo/Christian Bible is a corruption of stolen material that has been 
used to spiritually enslave humanity. All of the legends of the Gods are 
allegories. The Vatican and its cohorts have gained wealth, power, and control 
by forcing people to believe these allegories are literal places and characters. 
 
<P>The completion of the work, what is known in alchemy as the "Magnum Opus" has 
its foundation in the kundalini. The kundalini serpent lies coiled at the base 
of the spine. Through meditation, the fiery serpent ascends. This is what is 
known as "Raising the Devil." There are 33 vertebrae in the in the human spinal 
column. We often hear the term "33rd degree Mason" or that the fictitious 
nazarene lived 33 years. The kundalini serpent ascends the 33 vertebrae of the 
spine. 
<P>The seven chakras are also very important in the work. When the kundalini 
ascends, it must pierce through each of the seven chakras. This is why there is 
so much emphasis on the number seven in many ancient spiritual texts and also 
what has been corrupted in the Judeo/Christian Bible. Christian leaders mislead 
their followers through deceiving them into believing the stolen legends in the 
bible are real. Through this deception, the Vatican and Christian churches have 
obtained unbelievable wealth and power. This power is not only in the material 
world, but in the spiritual as well. All spiritual knowledge was systematically 
removed with the <A 
href="../../satanslibrary.org/ExposingChristianity/The_Inquisition.html">Inquisition.</A> 
Those at the top are adept at black magick and have advanced to spiritual power, 
while the rest of humanity suffers under their control. 
<P>Many ancient paintings we are told are of the nazarene, "virgin mary" and 
related are really of the Original Gods, such as Marduk (Amon Ra) and Astaroth. 
The Magnum Opus begins ideally in the spring when the Sun is in Aries, thus the 
man standing with the lamb. The halo is the ascended kundalini and the vibrant 
aura of witchpower. The Catholic Church stole this and has been passing it off 
as their fictitious nazarene. The glyphs for the sign of Aries can be readily 
seen in Astaroth's Sigil:<BR><IMG src="../../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/AstarothSigil.gif" 
width=100 height=110><BR>(All of the Demon Sigils are designs of important 
alchemical symbols). 
<P>The story of the creation in the book of genesis is another allegory: 
<I>"God' creates the universe in "seven days," "On the seventh day he 
rested."</I> Those of us who are educated know once the kundalini serpent has 
ascended through the 6 chakras and passed through the three "knots" (trinity), 
the seventh is effortless. In truth, "Heaven" is a code word for the seventh 
chakra. We have all heard the term "Seventh heaven." "God" is a code word for 
ourselves and also the word "Gods" is a code for the chakras in many ancient 
texts. "Hell" is a code word for the base chakra, aka "the lower world" where 
the scorching hot kundalini serpent lies dormant. 
<P>The tree in the "Garden of Eden" in the bible was stolen from many different 
religions predating Christianity and symbolizes a map of the human soul, the 
trunk of the tree representing the human spine, with the branches symbolizing 
the "144,000" nadis. "Adam and Eve" symbolize the Ida and the Pingala, where the 
two meet and become one. With the ascended kundalini and the fusion of the ida 
and pingala at the 6th chakra, gnosis is obtained and one's spiritual eyes are 
opened. This was originally symbolized in the Egyptian "All-seeing Eye." 
<BR><IMG src="eye.gif"> <BR>The separated capstone 
atop the pyramid symbolizes our Creator Satan's unfinshed work. 
<P>The number 12 is also ubiquitous in many ancient texts and also in the stolen 
material of the bible. The number 12 symbolizes the 12 steps in the magnum opus. 
These are based upon the 12 signs of the zodiac. 
<P>Genesis 1 <BR><I>1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
</I><BR>The heaven and earth symbolize the crown and base chakras 
<P><I>2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face 
of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</I> 
<BR>"Without form and void" represent what is known as the "chaos" stage in the 
magnum opus. 
<P><I>4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from 
the darkness.</I> <BR>The light is where one creates what is known as the prima 
materia, the foundation of the philosopher's stone. This is done by condensing 
the bioelectricity/chi into a ball of light. 
<P><I>5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the 
evening and the morning were the first day.</I> <BR>This is a first step and 
foundation, thus "the first day." 
<P><I>16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and 
the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. <BR>17 And God set 
them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, <BR>18 And to 
rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: 
and God saw that it was good. <BR>19 And the evening and the morning were the 
fourth day.</I> 
<P>The above verses regarding the "two great lights" symbolize the heart chakra, 
where "heaven" and "earth" meet. As we can see in the downward point of Satan's 
Sigil, the Satanic Pentagram, and Baphomet, light descends through the crown to 
the base chakra.<BR><IMG src="Fathers_Sigil.gif" 
width=100 height=110> 
<P><I>20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature 
that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of 
heaven.</I> <BR>"The elixir of life, the blessed waters, penetrate down to them 
[the metals/chakras] and rouse them from their sleep." This is what is known as 
the "dew" that is secreted by the pineal gland as a result of power meditation. 
Birds are also very important symbols in alchemy. 
<P><I>27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he 
him; male and female created he them. <BR>31 And God saw every thing that he had 
made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the 
sixth day.</I> 
<P>From the above, again the ALLEGORY is perverted and twisted. The "sixth day" 
is the sixth chakra where the male and female ida and pingala meet. 
<P><I>3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it 
he had rested from all his work, which God created and made. </I><BR>Here is 
another alchemical allegory that was stolen and twisted. When the alchemist has 
completed his/her work, he/she rests. "God" = OURSELVES! 
<P>The genesis saga continues, all of it stolen and corrupted from religions 
predating xianity. 
<P><I>Genesis 3: 3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the 
garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest 
ye die.</I> 
<P>There is the stage in alchemy where one undergoes a death of the prima 
materia. This is known as "nigredo" "black stage." 
<UL>
  <LI>"The initial, black stage of the opus alchymicum in which the body of the 
  impure metal, the matter of the Stone, or the old outmoded state of being is 
  killed, putrefied and dissolved into the original substance of the creation, 
  the prima materia, in order that it may be renovated and reborn in a new 
  form."¹ </LI></UL>
<P>Here is where the fictitious nazarene was also invented. The nazarene was 
stolen from some 18+ Pagan Gods who were "crucified" on a cross or hung from a 
tree. All of this is an allegory, for example: The Norse God Odin hung from a 
tree and experienced a death of sorts to obtain knowledge. Through being reborn, 
he obtained gnosis. The cross represents the all-important four quarters. This 
is also the meaning of the hanged man card in the Tarot. The Egyptian phoenix 
has the same meaning- rebirth through fire. The eclipse said to have occurred 
during the supposed "crucifixion" of the nazarene also symbolizes the nigredo 
stage of blackness. This stage is also symbolized by the black crow and the 
Black Sun. 
<P><I>4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</I> 
<BR>The kundalini serpent transforms, but does not kill. 
<P><I>5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall 
be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</I> <BR>This is the 
gnosis that the Christian Churches and their nefarious cohorts have relentlessly 
worked against. Once our eyes have been opened, we can no longer be deceived by 
ANY lies! 
<P><I>7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were 
naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 
</I><BR>Nakedness is another allegory of rebirth. Everyone is born naked. 
<P>Now, we get to "Noah" and the ark, which was stolen from the Sumerian epic of 
Ziusudra. 
<UL>
  <LI>"Noah's flood is a symbol for the 'dissolution of the Stone's matter into 
  the prima materia during the nigredo. At this stage of the opus, the cold, 
  moist, feminine principle (Luna) is said to dominate the hot, dry coagulating 
  male aspect of the opus (Sol)." ²</LI></UL>
<P>The water element is feminine, while the fire element is masculine. This 
stage of the opus is symbolized by a flood of energy which is symbolized by the 
flood of waters. The flood is another allegory of death and regeneration. The 
ark itself is symbolic of the human body. The allegory of the crow not returning 
to the ark is symbolic of the stage is not yet completed. The "dove" symbolizes 
the white stage aka the "albedo." 
<UL>
  <LI>"The albedo occurs after the blackened matter, the putrefied body of the 
  metal or the matter for the stone, lying dead at the bottom of the alembic, 
  has been washed to whiteness by the mercurial waters." ³</LI></UL>
<P>It is readily apparent how this allegory has been corrupted into an assumed 
actual event, complete with characters. 
<P><I>4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the 
month, upon the mountains of Ararat.</I> <BR>AGAIN, the number seven and "rest." 
This symbolizes the seventh chakra, which is effortless bliss and the " 
mountains of Ararat" symbolize the completed work, which was STOLEN from the 
meaning of the Egyptian pyramids- the apex point at the top which has its 
foundation at the four quarters. 
<P>Now, I might also add here- to the fools who have been attacking 
Enili/Beelzebub with drowning humanity- GET A LIFE!!!! <BR>Knowledge comes from 
Satan. 
<P><I>13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant 
between me and the earth. <BR>14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud 
over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: <BR>15 And I will 
remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of 
all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
</I>
<P>The "bow" is the rainbow, the iridescent colors that indicate another higher 
stage of the magnum opus has been completed. THIS STAGE, I MIGHT ADD IS ALSO 
SYMBOLIZED BY THE PEACOCK. THE PEACOCK IS A SYMBOL OF AND IS SACRED TO SATAN! 
<P>Verse 13 reads:<I> "a covenant between me and the earth."</I> "God" is 
another alchemical code word for the crown chakra, aka "heaven" (the top three 
chakras are also symbolic of 'heaven') "paradise" "bliss" and the earth is the 
lower world, symbolized by the three lower chakras. This indicates "heaven" and 
earth have been merged at the heart chakra. 
<P>The following biblical books are the fictitious history of the Jewish people. 
The "torah" was STOLEN and corrupted from the Egyptian Tarot. The "Torah" is 
also known as the "Pentateuch," the five books of "Moses" (another fictitious 
character). One can see this was stolen from the five suits of the Tarot- the 
wands/rods (suit of fire); the pentacles (suit of earth); the cups (suit of 
water); and the swords (suit of air) and of course the trump, representing the 
element of the quintessence. 
<UL>
  <LI>"The nigredo stage ends on the surface of a starry aspect, which is 
  likened to the night sky which told shepherds and kings that a child was born 
  in Bethlehem." <SUP>4</SUP></LI></UL>
<P>AGAIN, this is symbolic and indicates another stage of the work, when one can 
'see' the light of the chi stone in the black void, when one's eyes are closed, 
during meditation. The "three" magi represent the three stages of the work. The 
fictitious nazarene- the stone (which was born from the work). 
<UL>
  <LI>"There are three stones, or three works, or three degrees of perfection, 
  within the work." <SUP>5</SUP></LI></UL>
<P>Here we go again with twisted allegories in relation to that fictitious 
nazarene – the "crucifixion" – two others were crucified with the nazarene, 
making three. 
<P>I could go on and on and on, citing biblical verses and revealing how they 
were stolen and corrupted. The character of the nazarene, which was invented 
from an allegory has: 
<P>1. Acted to remove all spiritual knowledge and replace it with bullshit. The 
"Jesus saves" crap (ad nauseum) and the "born again" have been twisted and 
incorporated into this fictitious character. in other words, deluded ones have 
been deceived into believing this character will take care of everything 
spiritual as long as they conform to the agenda. 
<P>2. The "Jesus" character has acted as the thought police for ultimate 
control. Wars have been fought repeatedly over beliefs and ideas. Control what 
is in the mind of humanity and you will control humanity. 
<P>3. Since the nazarene is fictitious, he can be anything to anyone which those 
in powerful positions in the xian program dictate. He can change with the times 
and conform to any agenda. 
<P>It is time everyone wakes up to the spiritual corruption that has played 
humanity to the tune of trillions and trillions of dollars, souls and everything 
else these parasites have taken their followers for a ride with.
