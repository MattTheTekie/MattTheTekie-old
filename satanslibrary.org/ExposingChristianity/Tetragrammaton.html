<P><BR><FONT size=3 face=Verdana,Arial>For those of you who are forever making 
endless posts regarding your problems with Christian indoctrination, please do 
not be lazy. Read the following article before making more and more posts 
regarding your psychological problems in overcoming Christian lies, and then 
apply yourself to meditation. I have written extensively concerning spiritual 
allegories. Most average people cannot see through the hidden meanings behind 
the allegories and they take the tales of the Gods and the legends as literal. 
First off...Satan and the Powers of Hell do not demand any slavish worship. They 
are our friends. They are and have been trying to help us. They are 
extra-terrestrial beings. The Jews are always on the attack, when one mentions 
extra-terrestrial beings. 
<P>With extensive and advanced meditation, like the symbolic cobra serpent, one 
experiences increased awareness and one's mind expands [symbolized by the hood 
of the cobra]. When you can finally see the truth, and see through all of the 
lies of Christianity, Islam and its ugly Jewish root, these programs are no 
longer a threat. There does come a point when no amount of lying or coercion 
will get one who has seen and who knows the truth to believe the lies any 
longer. I keep reading in these groups on and off when approving posts, just how 
much Christianity has taken hold in the minds of many people here. Satan has 
been showing me more and more as I have opened myself in both my meditations and 
my studies. To know the truth, one must study extensively into the "occult" 
subjects of which the bible threatens against. I have done this for many, many 
years. 
<P>While I have made many references to "jehova" and that filthy jewsus 
nazarene, for the umpteenth time, neither one of these entities exist. Both are 
thoughtforms to some extent and there are enemy extraterrestrials such as the 
greys who work under the reptilians out there for the enslavement of the 
Gentiles on this planet, along with some enemy Nordics who pose as these 
fictitious entities and also promote them. Before there were modern cameras and 
available information regarding extra-terrestrials, occultist Aleister Crowley 
when in a trance drew a picture of "Jehova" and it was an illustration of one of 
those bulb-headed greys. Ok, enough said, but If I don't repeat myself ad 
nauseum giving some background on this, people who are new will be lost 
regarding what I am now going to write. 
<P>If you delve into occult teachings far enough, and occult societies such as 
Freemasonry, etc., [much of the spiritual teachings have been systematically 
removed and what remains is corrupted]. Most of these organizations know of the 
powers of the soul to some extent. Freemasonry, before it was corrupted by the 
Jews, was very spiritual and a "33rd Degree mason" was one who had his serpent 
ascended, as the spine has an esoteric 33 degrees. Way back when, accomplished 
Freemasons communicated with each other telepathically. Rebuilding the "Temple 
of Solomon" had to do with the magnum opus and the soul. The Jews have taken 
this CONCEPT and have corrupted it to advance their insatiable greed and direct 
it towards their communist agenda of creating a Gentile slave state. 
<P>666 is the Kabbalistic square of the Sun. 666 is the all-important solar 
chakra. The true meaning of the "Temple of Solomon" is the TEMPLE OF THE SUN. 
"Sol" "Om" and "On" are all words for the Sun. "Sol" is the Latin word for the 
Sun and is close to the English word "soul." "Om" is a name given by the Hindus 
to the Spiritual Sun and "On" is an Egyptian word for Sun. The symbolism of the 
Temple of Solomon was stolen by the Jews and made into a fictitious character, 
as with the fictitious Nazarene and nearly everything in the Judeo/Christian 
Bible. The true meaning of the "Temple of the Sun" is spiritual. This symbolizes 
the perfected soul, where the rays from the solar [666] chakra, which is the 
center of the soul and circulates spiritual energy, radiates into eight separate 
rays. The shining soul is symbolized by the sun. Eight is the number of 
Astaroth. This is also "The New Jerusalem." The name of "Jerusalem" has also 
been stolen and corrupted into a city in Israel. "Jerusalem" IS A CONCEPT! The 
shining perfected soul is also symbolic as "The Light." 
<P>Now, most of you already know how that annoying fish symbol the Christians 
use is in truth a vagina turned on its side. It is called a "Yoni." If you look 
to many versions of the Tarot cards, even going way back into the Middle Ages, 
you will find the suits of the rods/wands and the swords are often in the shape 
of a yoni. The heart chakra [neuter chakra] is also in the shape of a yoni. The 
yoni, symbolizing the vagina is also symbolic of giving birth to a new soul and 
achieving spiritual and physical perfection and immortality through the magnum 
opus. The Christian crap of being "born again" is false, and amounts to nothing 
more than spiritual degeneracy, and being steeped in more lies. 
<P>There are thirteen major chakras upon the soul. For a very long time, the 
enemy has touted the number 13 as unlucky, etc. This is to frighten people away 
from that number. This is no different from how horror movies are used to 
frighten people away from the spiritual/occult. All of this ties in. When one 
does a ritual, one invokes the four quarters. To the uninitiated, one points 
one's athame, calls out, etc. To those who know, this is actually an allegory 
for vibrating the soul to raise your own powers. The soul has four important 
directions; again, male and female. 
<P>This is what the enemy uses the "YHVH" for, though the YHVH is a corruption. 
The uneducated, the stupid, and the fools are deluded into believing this "YHVH" 
is some sort of Supreme Being. AGAIN, THIS IS A CONCEPT!! Not only is this a 
concept, it was stolen, then of course, it was further corrupted. There is no 
supreme being. There is infinity in both the microcosm and the macrocosm. There 
is no such thing as some big bad Jewish spook that "created everything" and who 
is omnipotent and all of that horse manure they push on the unsuspecting public. 
There is a war going on 'out there' and there are ET's who work through the Jews 
here, who do hate humanity and want to enslave the world in order to provide a 
ready and easy host to leech energy off of souls. This is no different from 
cattle in a slaughterhouse. This is what we are to them and it all depends upon 
just how ignorant and unknowing one is, for the enemy to succeed. We have been 
cut off from our spiritual senses. Few can see what the enemy is doing, but 
through meditation and the Serpent of Satan, our spiritual eyes are opened. 
<P>Getting back to the four quarters of the soul, following the RAUM meditation, 
<AS HREF="../../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/RAUM_Meditation.html">RAUM Meditation</A>One 
should vibrate the four quarters of the soul. IO can work for all four, but one 
will notice a drastic charge and empowerment if the four quarters are vibrated 
correctly. IO was taken from the Greek IO. Nearly all of the Greek so-called 
"myths" are very important spiritual concepts, with the exception of some of the 
legends of the Gods such as Heracles; the account of his birth [his human mother 
had a very difficult time, as he was fathered by one of the Gods [ET's] and the 
Nordic ET's are much larger and taller than us humans. I have seen a couple who 
were near 8 feet tall, such as Anubis. Heracles was a Demi-God, meaning he was 
half-human. <A 
href="https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Io/io.html">IO 
is another allegory</A> and while many of these Gods are actual beings, their 
legends are important spiritual allegories, such as the Greek "Argus" which is 
Agares. Agares is female, but the allegory portrays a male. The "thousand eyes" 
of the spiritually empowered soul. <BR><I>"During her wanders she came across 
Prometheus while chained. He gave her hope. He predicted that she would have to 
wander for many years. But, she would eventually be changed back into human form 
and would bear a child. He predicted that a descendent of this child would be a 
great hero and set him free. <BR>His predictions came true. During her 
wanderings many geographical features were named after her including the Ionian 
Sea, and the Bosphorus (which means ford of the cow). She eventually reached the 
Nile where Zeus did restore her to human form. She bore Epaphus and eleven 
generations later her descendant Heracles would set Prometheus 
free.</I><SUP>1</SUP> 
<P>Going a step further, EA is another name for Satan. [Most of you already know 
the name "Satan" means "truth" in one of the most ancient of languages 
Sanskrit]. EA is pronounced AY-AH. AY as in May, say, day, etc. Nearly all of 
the words in Sanskrit end in the letter A. The letter A symbol in English and in 
many other Western alphabets is tapered like the pyramids, and many other 
spiritual symbols. The taper is symbolic of the serpentine energy ascending the 
soul. This also has to do with focus on the spine. The so-called 
"tetragrammaton" of the soul follows as I-O-E-A. EE-OH-AY-AH. These are the four 
vowel vibrations that empower and raise the energies of the four quarters of the 
soul to a high level. Right shoulder/right side of the body, vibrate I [EEEEE]; 
Left shoulder/left side of the body, Vibrate O [OOHHHH]. Front side of your 
body, vibrate E [AAYYY] as in the word say, or may On your backside, focusing on 
your spine, vibrate A [AHHHH] 
<P>Now, one can see where this vibration was stolen, altered, and completely 
corrupted from a PAGAN CONCEPT into that foul Jewish invented entity "jehova." 
Again and again, I reiterate THE WORD "GOD" IS A CODE-WORD FOR THE SELF!!! THERE 
IS NO "JEHOVA" OR "YAHWEH" WHICH WAS TAKEN FROM IDIOT CHRISTIANS TRYING TO 
PRONOUNCE "YHVH," AS THE J IS OFTEN PRONOUNCED AS Y IN MANY LANGUAGES, AFTER 
THIS CONCEPT WAS STOLEN AND CORRUPTED BY THE JEWS. The Christians are so far 
deluded it is way beyond pathetic. The Jews have usurped spiritual knowledge and 
corrupted it in order to enslave and control the entire world, they, themselves, 
at the higher levels becoming "God." In truth, that is all it is...a vibration 
to drastically empower the soul. 
<P>Going further, I also have written about this before. Once you have enough 
knowledge and obstacles to enlightenment have been knocked down in your mind, 
this can easily be seen. The nazarene was stolen from and invented into another 
fictitious Jewish character for Gentiles to slavishly worship- the serpent. 
Nearly every painting or illustration of so-called "saints" of which in Spanish 
is "Santa" an anagram of Satan, THEY ARE ALL DEPICTED WITH HALOS, WHICH 
REPRESENTS THE RISEN SERPENT OF SATAN!! This is not just a Western concept, but 
is also seen extensively in the Far East [where Christianity stole nearly all of 
its corrupted content from], as with the Buddha, also seen with a halo. 
<P>Now, getting back to those paintings that we are told is the nazarene, in 
truth, they are nothing more than an illustration of a man with his serpent 
ascended, no different from any other illustrated instructions; same as with the 
so-called "saints." When you purchase any appliances, etc., these normally will 
come with illustrated instructions, or the same as with some one in an 
illustration showing the certain steps to using an appliance or whatever. For 
more information, click here for the article, <A href="The_Truth_About_Jesus_Christ.html">The Truth About Jesus 
Christ</A> 
<P>The nazarene is nothing more than a Jewish invented character that has been 
used to replace the serpent. The paintings are a how-to, A CONCEPT, depicted by 
a man. As I already wrote some time ago, if the same were done with Sponge-Bob, 
millions upon millions would prostrate themselves before the mighty image of 
Sponge-Bob in reverence, worship, and self-devotion. Using a sponge for cleaning 
purposes would become a blasphemy and a major sacrilege. This would then through 
the mass mind, take on a life of its own; a thoughtform if you will. A sponge 
would adorn every altar. There would be giant, colossal sponges where the most 
holy would make a special pilgrimage, not to that stupid black box in Mecca, but 
to the giant sponge edifice. The tiny pineapple residence of Sponge-Bob would be 
heaven under the sea, with the end goal for every "saved" individual to, instead 
of floating up to the sky in the ether, would descend to the depths of the ocean 
in hopes of finding the tiny little home to spend the rest of eternity within. 
<P>Kidding aside, given the endless and copious amounts of spiritual energy that 
are directed into this fictitious nazarene character, the misguided and false 
sense of belief and with this outrageous lie being promoted at every level, 
embedded in the minds of the populace through force, with no alternative, no 
wonder it has reached the monstrous level it has. In addition, that nazarene was 
also corrupted from the five elements, Hebrew style. When one has enough 
knowledge and has opened his/her mind, and through the Grace of Satan, one can 
see all of this. 
<P>Christianity is pushed upon the populace with no other alternative. Even in 
doing crossword puzzles, [most are written by Jews], that Christian biblical 
crap has to be in there for the words/answers. As for Modern Paganism, Buddhism, 
Wicca and everything else that is related and has been corrupted from the 
original Paganism, all has been Christianized. The Jews even go a step further 
in dictating to the Gentiles that the powers of the mind are not to be used for 
material gain, which is an utter crock of shit. <BR>Quote from the Talmud: 
<BR>22. Seph. Jp., 92, 1: "God has given the Jews power over the possessions and 
blood of all nations." 
<P>Fundamentalist Christians work relentlessly to remove Santa from xmas and 
replace him with the nazarene, take the Easter Bunny out of Easter and again, 
replace the rabbits and eggs with the nazarene; and this includes all of the 
other holidays. For more information regarding this, see the article concerning 
<A href="STOLEN_YEAR.html">The Stolen Year.</A> The 
Jehova's Witnesses also go a step further and work to remove all symbols which 
they tout as "graven images," as the destruction of important spiritual symbols 
will eventually be the death of spiritual knowledge and truths. 
<P>ALL of the occult and the spiritual teachings have the end objective of 
empowering the soul, raising the serpent, and performing the magnum opus. If one 
will look through open eyes, no amount of coercing, lying, or "explaining" will 
fool you again. The only thing one can do from this point is to work to wake up 
humanity to the truth! 
<P>HAIL SATAN!!!
